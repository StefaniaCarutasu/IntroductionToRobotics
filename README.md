# IntroductionToRobotics
 Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.
 
 # Homework 1 - RGB LED
 
## Requirements

Control a RGB led by using separate potentiometers in controlling each of the colors of the led (Red, Green, Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics.

## Implementation details

Since the values read from each potentiometer are in the interval [0..1023], they need to be mapped to the accepted values by each led which are in the interval [0..255].
